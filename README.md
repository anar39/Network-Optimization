# Network-Optimization
The first project explores organizational network analysis, using centrality measures and clustering coefficients. Additionally, I use the integer programming solver Gurobi for optimizing tour selections.

The second project focuses on community detectionwithin networks. I employ the Girvan-Newman and Louvain algorithms to detect community structures effectively.
