# Network-Optimization
The first project (NetworkOptimization-Project1.ipynb) explores organizational network analysis, using centrality measures and clustering coefficients. Additionally, I use the integer programming solver Gurobi for optimizing tour selection.

The second project (NetworkOptimization-Project2.ipynb) focuses on community detectionwithin networks. I employ the Girvan-Newman and Louvain algorithms to detect community structures effectively.
